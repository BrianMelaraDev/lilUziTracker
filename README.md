#Lil Uzi Tracker
This Full-Stack Application called the Uzi Tracker allows users to login and be welcomed to a user-friendly interface that allows users to track their favorite lil uzi or any songs for that matter. The day you listend to those songs are logged and you can add other days you listend to songs. With the use of MongoDB I am able to save user data and retrirve it back for the user when an edit is made. I am deploying the server with Express in Node.js.
